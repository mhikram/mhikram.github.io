So <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/">Hackweek 14</a> is over. It started during the <a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16">openSUSE Conference 2016</a> on Friday June 24 and continued all over the following week.
</p>

<p>
I had worked on <a href="../2016-06-09-config-drift-salt-snapper/index.html">integrating snapshots with Salt</a> with <a href="https://github.com/meaksh">Pablo</a> just some weeks before that and I was waiting for the openSUSE Conference to get the chance to show <a href="https://twitter.com/thatch45">Thomas</a> what we had done in order to get feedback and figure out next steps.
</p>

<p>
A few days before the Conference Redhat <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-launches-ansible-native-container-workflow-project">did a press release</a> that caught my attention: a framework to build container images with <a href="https://www.ansible.com">Ansible</a>. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. My head started immediately to think all day long about the challenges to build something like that: Installing the configuration management tool without leaving it there, etc. I got curious and started poking at the README.
</p>

<p>
On one hand, it was not what I was expecting (well, at least, for a Press Release or Tech Preview). It still &ldquo;generated&rdquo; Dockerfiles, relied on Ansible to be installed in some way, wich was &ldquo;templated&rdquo; into Dockerfiles, and it was of course a new tool.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it was pure inspiration: I remembered why I like Salt so much. I knew that with Salt <a href="../2016-05-18-using-salt-like-ansible/index.html">I wouldn&rsquo;t need to build a &ldquo;new tool&rdquo;</a>. I&rsquo;d only need to write a module and connect some pieces, and that makes my feature distributed, accessible, deployable, etc. I&rsquo;d not need to interact with Docker directly, but only with the <a href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.dockerng.html">Salt execution module</a> for it. The best part: I had a Hackweek project!.
</p>

<p>
I used the chance that <a href="https://twitter.com/thatch45">Thomas</a> was at the openSUSE Conference to ask him some details about <code>salt-thin</code> and explain him rough ideas.
</p>

<p>
The feature went more or less like expected:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Docker image is basically another image, modified.</li>
<li>The problem can be reduced to run a Salt state run inside of the container, modulo problems.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The image does not have Salt.</li>
<li>After the State run, we can&rsquo;t leave Salt there.</li>
<li>The container does not have connectivity with the Salt master.</li>
<li>Pillars may be templated against grains which come from the
container.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
After tackling the problems one by one, you can factor some stuff out:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If <code>dockerng.build_sls</code> needs to apply state on a new container and commit it, why not allow to call state on a running container?.
<code>dockerng.sls</code> was born.</li>
<li>If we are going to call <code>state.sls</code> and <code>grains.items</code> on the container, why not allow to call <i>any</i> module in a container?. <code>dockerng.call</code> was born.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On Friday I was able to give the following Lightning Talk:
</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2znjgf9Q7J0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>
The result is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can build images using your own <code>salt://</code> tree modules only needing Python on the base image. And yes, you can consume pillar data.</li>
<li>You can execute modules on containers. Which will be interesting to see how it can be used for auditing (eg. <a href="https://github.com/HubbleStack">HubbleStack</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
I prepared a <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/34484">pull request</a>, which had the best reception I ever got on a pull request:

<p>
There are some details to polish and I hope it can be merged soon.
