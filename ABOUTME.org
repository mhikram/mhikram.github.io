If you've made it here you've probably heard me speak at an event or on some media outlet. I do that sometimes. The rest of the time I'm trying to build inclusive financial services infrastructure for developing economies.

I've been around a few different blocks. Failed more often than succeeded. This blog is here to let me talk about things that interest me and start conversations.

I'll also (sometimes) document my adventures in trying to self-learn a bunch of things.

(Oh and I'm the kind of person that has suddenly fallen hard for Org-Mode. Emacs not so much. That might be your cue to leave or be very very intrigued)
