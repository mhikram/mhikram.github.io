#+title: Blog setup in org-mode

* Introduction

This setup based on [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] to publish my site.

* Implementation

This version is inspired by [[https://duncan.codes/posts/2019-09-03-migrating-from-jekyll-to-org/index.html][Duncan Code]].

I will be migrating to a more minimalist setup (hopefully) soon.

* Usage

- Posts go into =posts/=
  Preferably in their own subdirectory together with all their assets (self-contained)
- Presentations go in =presentations/=, as they are rendered (for now) with the [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][revea.js]].

To generate:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ make
#+END_EXAMPLE

The output site will be rendered in =public/=.

** RSS Feeds

I am documenting this part because it is complicated and I tend to forget how it works everytime something breaks.

- Each export block in the project translates the full site, file by file, to another format (taking into account excludes, includes)
  As we have very different settings for the posts than we have for presentations, we have different entries in the project for translating each subset.

- Sitemaps allow to generate a map of all converted files in a single org file.
  Eg. a sitemap in posts, will generate an org file with a list of links to all posts. This is particularly useful for the rss exporter.

- We have an export entry in the project that goes over __posts/_, takes a dummy export function, but generates a sitemap. This allows us to end with a _rss.org_ file without really exporting anything.

- Then we use another entry in the project, that uses the _RSS_ exporter, including only _rss.org_ in order to generate _rss.xml_

- Now, the default sitemap function generates something like:

  #+BEGIN_SRC txt
    * Entries
      - [[One entry][http://link]]
      - [[Second entry][http://link]]
  #+END_SRC

  Those will not be exported correctly to a list of links. Only the headline  will be exported in the RSS file.

  #+BEGIN_SRC txt
    * [[One entry][http://link]]
    * [[Second entry][http://link]]
  #+END_SRC

- By default, the link will reference the file where the link appears. Something like
  #+BEGIN_SRC txt
  <link>http://rss.org#section</link>
  #+END_SRC

  To change this we use _org-rss-use-entry-url-as-guid_ and set the _RSS_PERMALINK_ property of the headline when generating the sitemap.
  The _RSS_ exporter will then use the property for the _<link>_ tag content.

- The custom entry formatter adds a headline to a temp buffer and then uses _org-set-property_ to set the custom properties.
- The sitemap function uses _org-list-to-generic_ to create a list of headlines without adding a star, as it will be added by the entry function.

* Features

*** Redirection

  When the site was generated using Jekyll, posts where generated in the =/:year/:month/:day/:id.html= route.
  In order to generate a redirect page, use the following keyword to generate a redirect page:

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+REDIRECT_FROM /old/url/index.html
  #+END_SRC

** Drafts

 To hide a post from the list of recent posts or the full archive, use:

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+DRAFT t
  #+END_SRC
 
  Note that the post will still be published, but you will need to access it by its URL directly.
